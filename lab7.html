<strong>3 Idiots</strong> is a comedy of ideas that is as provocative as funny, as wildly entertaining as insightful. A laugh-riot that talks about the most important of human pursuits: <strong>self-actualization.</strong>
<br>
3 Idiots a funny movie by Director. Rajkumar Hirani. I Personally like this movies because true friendship lasts forever.Two friends are searching for their long lost companion. They revisit their college days and recall the memories of their friend who inspired them to think differently even as the rest of the world called them “idiots”.  
It was loosely adapted from the novel "Five Point Someone" by Chetan Bhagat. 
3 Idiots stars Aamir Khan, Kareena Kapoor. R. Madhavan, Sharman Joshi and Boman Irani.

<br>It's a story of their hostel days that swings between Rancho's romance with the spirited Pia (Kareena Kapoor), and his clash with an oppressive mentor, Viru Sahastrabudhhe (Boman Irani).
Finally, in misty mountains of unparalleled beauty, the friends find the key to the secret that they seek.
