<h2><u> About iphone5s </u></h2>


<p style="background-color: cyan; color:darkorchid">
The iPhone 5s is Apple's current flagship phone. The 7th generation iPhone, it was introduced by Phil Schiller at the iPhone event on September 10, 2013 and released on September 20 alongside iOS 7. 
Physically the iPhone 5s looked identical to the previous year's iPhone 5, including the 4-inch 1136x640 in-cell display.
The iPhone 5s is powered by the 64-bit Apple A7 system-on-a-chip (SoC). It's the first 64-bit SoC on the market and that Apple got there before companies that fabricate their own chips is a testament to Apple's drive. 
The A7 includes a 1.3GHz dual-core custom Cyclone processor based on the ARM v8 instruction set, and a OpenGL ES 3.0-equipped PowerVR G6430 graphics processor.

The rear-facing iSight has also been improved for the iPhone 5s. It's still 8 megapixels but it's got a wider f/2.2 aperture and bigger 1.5 micron sensor. 
Thanks to the new image signal processor (ISP) in the Apple A7, the iPhone 5s iSight camera also gets better balance, better exposure, better sharpness, better low-light, less color distortion, less motion blur. 
The front-facing FaceTime camera on the iPhone 5s was also improved. The sensor size went to 1.9 microns and Apple changed to a back illuminated sensor (BSI). Always wanted better low-light selfies? Knock yourself out!

Touch ID, Apple's fingerprint identity sensor, debuted with the iPhone 5s.
<span id="align"><strong><em>It lets you use biometric authentication to unlock your iPhone and authorize purchases on the iTunes Store, App Store, and iBookstore. It works with a capacitive sensor that detects your finger, snaps a high-resolution image of it, converts it to a mathematical hash, sends it directly to a secure enclave on the Apple A7 chipset and, if it matches, releases a yes/no token that either verifies or rejects your print.</strong></em></span>
Each Touch ID sensor is paired with a specific Apple A7 processor, and the fingerprints are never allowed out of the Touch ID system and never transmitted or stored on any servers. If your phone is rebooted or if you haven't used Touch ID for 48 hours, you'll have to use your passcode to reactivate it.
