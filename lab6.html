<div id="description1">
<strong>3 Idiots</strong> is a comedy of ideas that is as provocative as funny, as wildly entertaining as insightful. A laugh-riot that talks about the most important of human pursuits: <strong>self-actualization.</strong>
<br>
Two friends (Madhavan and Sharman Joshi) embark on a quest for a lost buddy. On this journey, they encounter a long forgotten bet, a wedding they must crash and a funeral that goes impossibly out of control.
As they make their way through the perilous landscape, another journey begins: their inner journey through memory lane and the story of their friend – the irrepressible free thinker Rancho (Aamir Khan), who in his unique way, touched and changed their lives. 
<br>It's a story of their hostel days that swings between Rancho's romance with the spirited Pia (Kareena Kapoor), and his clash with an oppressive mentor, Viru Sahastrabudhhe (Boman Irani).
Finally, in misty mountains of unparalleled beauty, the friends find the key to the secret that they seek.

What is education? Is it mere securing of good grades and mugging up books? Are those who swot day and night and follow the study curriculum mechanically the ideal pupils? 
Does the entire burden of education leave any room for original thought? 
<br>
<span> Rajkumar Hirani’s film 3 Idiots attempts to tackle and answer these questions.</span>
