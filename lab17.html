<h2>Leaking personal information</h2>
<p>"Public Wi-Fi is inherently unsecure. Anyone using it ought to do so with the premise that everything you do is visible to a third-party stranger with access to that hot spot," People when connected to public networks are, unaware their Internet activity was being spied on by the team.
 Research says,in just a half-hour period, 250 devices connected to the hotspot. Most of these were probably automatic connections, without their owner even realizing it. 
People actively sent Internet traffic, doing web searches, sending email, etc.

<h2>Hackers Attack</h2>
<p>The biggest threat to free WiFi security is the ability for the hacker to position himself between you and the connection point. 
So instead of talking directly with the hotspot, you're sending your information to the hacker, who then relays it on.</p>
<h2>Snooping</h2>
<p>Encryption normally helps protect your network traffic from prying eyes. 
For example, even if your neighbor at home is within range of your Wi-Fi network, they can’t see the web pages you’re viewing. 
This wireless traffic is encrypted between your laptop, tablet, or smartphone and your wireless router. It’s encrypted with your Wi-Fi passphrase.</p>
<h2>Compromised Devices</h2>
<p>Compromised laptops and other devices may also be connected to the local network. 
When connecting, be sure to select the “Public network” Wi-Fi option in Windows and not the Home network or Work network options.
 The Public network option locks down the connection, ensuring Windows isn’t sharing any files or other sensitive data with the machines on the local network.
