I.COOKING
<br>
There are many enjoyable hobbies. But nothing can even come close to cooking as a hobby.The joy of following a cookbook to produce a dish is a great experience in itself and if the end result is good then it is even more satisfying for the person and the admiration from others is an added bonus. 
The reason i like cooking is that you can learn cooking and improve your skills right at home.

III. MUSIC
<blockquote>
Music is the art or science of combining vocal or instrumental sounds (sometimes both) to produce beauty of form, harmony, and expression of emotion.
<blockquote>
As a teenager, I listen to music everyday. I can name almost name every song that comes on the radio. Listening to music takes the stress away from my mind.
