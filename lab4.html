<h2 style="color:blue">COOKING</h2>
A hobby is a regular activity that is done for pleasure, typically during one's leisure time.There are many enjoyable hobbies. But nothing can even come close to cooking as a hobby.The joy of following a cookbook to produce a dish is a great experience in itself and if the end result is good then it is even more satisfying for the person and the admiration from others is an added bonus. 
The reason i like cooking is that you can learn cooking and improve your skills right at home.
