			WASHINGTON-U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Director <br> Leon Rodriguez announced that, effective May 26, 2015, the Department of <br>Homeland Security (DHS) is extending eligibility for employment authorization <br> to certain H-4 dependent spouses of H-1B nonimmigrants who are seeking <br> employment-based lawful permanent resident (LPR) status.<br><br>
			<pre id="pre">
											DHS amended the 
											regulations to allow 
											these H-4 dependent
											spouses to accept 
											employment in the 
											United States.</pre>

			H4 was said to be a curse, spouses whoes husband/ wife had come on h1b were not allowed to work. They could just study and sit at home.<br>
			I believe that this would help US government to have more efficient and skilled workers to develop economy by making contributions in their respective field.<br>
			This will definitely have positve impact on overall economy.
