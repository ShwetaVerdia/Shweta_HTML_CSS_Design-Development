My husband did booking in my favourite restaurant for dinner. We went for dinner and had an awesome Indian food with drinks.
<br>
Yesterday it was World cup cricket match between India and Pakistan so we watched match after coming home from dinner. And the best part was India won the game. So it was an awesome day filled with joy and happiness.
